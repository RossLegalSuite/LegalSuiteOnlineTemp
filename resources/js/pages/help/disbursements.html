    <p>A Disbursement is a payment which are made on behalf of another person for which reimbursement in the future is expected.

    <p>Disbursements can be made for payments such as rates, taxes, deposits, court filing fees, expert medical reports, private investigators as well as miscellaneous expenses such as photocopying, registered post and courier costs. These are made by the attorney on behalf of the person (usually the Client) to facilitate and expediate the legal process.</p>

    <p>From an accounting point of view, a Disbursement is actually a <em>short-term loan</em> to that person and should be reflected as such on the Balance Sheet.</p>

    <p>When you create a Disbursement in Ettorney, 
        a <strong>Disbursement Payment</strong> is created
        the following <strong>Accounting Transactions</strong> are made to reflect the Payment:</p>

    <p>1) The <strong>Business Bank Account</strong> (Asset) is <em>credited</em>.</p>
    <p>2) The <strong>Disbursements Control Account</strong> (Asset) is <em>debited</em>.</p>

    <p>To recover the Disbursement, you need to either:</p>
    <p>1) Create a specific Invoice for the Disbursement.</p>
    <p>2) Ensure that the Disbursement is added to an Invoice at a later date.</p>
