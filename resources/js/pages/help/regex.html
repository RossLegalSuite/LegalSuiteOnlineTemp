    <p>Regular Expressions, also known as Regex, is a system developed to help find 
        specific text within sentences. It uses symbols to create search patterns 
        that allow you to more precisely locate the text you want to replace.</p>

    <p>Regex looks complicated, but the basic symbols can be very useful to
        find and replace text with a little practice. You can undo a Search & Replace if the results are not what you expected.</p>

    <p><strong>For Example:</strong></p>    
    <p>1) You can use the vertical pipe symbol (|) to search for any two words. For example, searching for <strong>document|letter</strong> will find <em>document</em> as well as <em>letter</em>.</p>
    <p>2) You can use a period (.) to search for text that may contain some text inside some other text. For example, searching for <strong>d.t</strong> will find <em>document</em> as well as <em>docket</em>, <em>deposit</em> and any other text beginning and ending with d and t.</p>
    <p>3) You can word boundaries (\b) to only search for the word <em>document</em> and not other occurences of "document" that may be <em>inside</em> other words such as <em>documentation</em> by searching for <strong>\bdocument\b</strong>.</p>
    <p>4) You can specify that the text you are searching for must be at the end of the sentence. For example, searching for <strong>document$</strong> with only find the last <em>document</em> in the sentence "Perused document and sent document".</p>
        
    <p>There are numerous learning resources on the Internet, but here are some of the more common Regex tags you can use:</em>.
