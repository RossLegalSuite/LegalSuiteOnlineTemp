First: Debit what comes in, Credit what goes out.
Second: Debit all expenses and losses, Credit all incomes and gains.
Third: Debit the receiver, Credit the giver.


Remember this equation:
Assets = liabilities + equity

Assets are on the left side of the equal sign. 
Asset accounts are increased with a debit. 
Liability and equity accounts are on the right side on the equal sign and they are increased with credits. 
If you need to increase the balance of an account, consider what type of account it is. 
Once you know that, youâ€™ll know how to increase the account (either debit or credit).

Say that you need to increase accounts payable. 
Payables are liability accounts. 
That means that you increase accounts payable by crediting.
