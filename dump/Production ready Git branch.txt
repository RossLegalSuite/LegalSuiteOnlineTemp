Have a production ready Git branch of your App
====================================================================================

When we are developing our app we don’t want to have to make sure all our changes constantly need to be ready for production.

As such, we need to create a production version of our app which we can merge production ready changes into when they are fit for deployment.

On your local machine where you are developing our app (assuming we have installed Git installed) open a terminal and navigate to the folder where you are developing and have your repo. Create a production branch of the project.

//On your local/dev machine!
git branch production

Whenever your development or other branches are ready to have their changes pushed into production we have to enter into the production branch.

So let’s switch into the production branch.

git checkout production

Merge our development changes. Make sure you have committed your changes in the development branch! (Replace master with your development branch name).

git merge --no-ff master

Note: Adding ‘ -- no-ff’ makes sure it creates a new commit is made so we can track development merges into production.


Push this new branch so it appears on our remote GitHub repository.

git push origin production

(You may want to switch back to your dev branch to develop on it later. Simply use the command ‘git checkout master’ to switch back.)

Pull in your production branch

Note: Whenever you need to pull down the production branch of your project just cd into the directory and run ‘git pull origin production’.

git pull origin production
