Hi

Ok - I finally resolved it.

I see that you used WHM to upload the sqlsrv_pdo driver.

The LAST STEP was to tell PHP to use the extension.

In PHP 7 and later, there is this note in the php.ini file:

; Note: packaged extension modules are now loaded via the .ini files
; found in the directory /etc/php.d; these are loaded by default.

In previous versions of PHP, we simply added something like this to the php.ini:

extension=pdo_sqlsrv.so

But now we have to add an ini file like this:

 /opt/cpanel/ea-php72/root/etc/php.d/30-pdo_sqlsrv.ini

 with one line in it:

 extension=pdo_sqlsrv.so

 I created this file and then restarted PHP-FPM and Apache

 /scripts/restartsrv_apache_php_fpm
 /scripts/restartsrv_httpd

... and it all works perfectly. 

Thanks for all your help.
